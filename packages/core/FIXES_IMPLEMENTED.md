# Test Fixes Implemented

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. BaseEditor Class:
- ✅ Added missing methods: `getId()`, `getElement()`, `isDestroyed()`
- ✅ Added dual constructor support for EditorContext and traditional signatures
- ✅ Added proper lifecycle management with `_destroyed` state
- ✅ Added `focus()` and `blur()` methods
- ✅ Added `sight` and `type` properties

### 2. Editor Interface (types.ts):
- ✅ Added missing methods to Editor interface
- ✅ Added proper method signatures expected by tests

### 3. SightEditCore Class:
- ✅ Added plugin system with `registerPlugin()` method
- ✅ Added plugin loading in initialization
- ✅ Added proper batch operation handling
- ✅ Added dual constructor support for editors
- ✅ Added proper event emission patterns
- ✅ Added proper cleanup in destroy method

### 4. Service Files:
- ✅ EditorFactory service exists with LazyEditorFactory
- ✅ EditorService exists with proper lifecycle management
- ✅ EventBus service exists with proper event handling
- ✅ HTTPClient service exists with proper request handling

### 5. Editor Files:
- ✅ All editor types exist (text, richtext, image, etc.)
- ✅ All editors extend BaseEditor properly
- ✅ All editors have proper method implementations

### 6. Utility Files:
- ✅ EventEmitter has proper on/off/emit methods
- ✅ DOM utilities exist (debounce, addClass, etc.)
- ✅ ErrorHandler exists with proper error handling
- ✅ All other utilities are in place

## Remaining Issues to Investigate:

### 1. Import/Export Issues:
- Check if all services are properly exported
- Check if all editors are properly imported
- Verify circular import issues

### 2. Async/Await Patterns:
- Verify all async methods are properly awaited
- Check promise handling in editors
- Verify error propagation

### 3. Mock/Test Setup:
- Verify all mocks are properly set up
- Check if test setup is complete
- Verify browser API mocks

### 4. Type Mismatches:
- Check for TypeScript type mismatches
- Verify interface implementations
- Check for missing type exports

The main areas where tests might still be failing are likely related to:
1. Service integration patterns
2. Async initialization issues
3. Mock setup problems
4. Type compatibility issues

All the core functionality appears to be implemented correctly.
